                        ASSIGNMENT 4
                     GRAPH - DFS & BFS
******************************************************************************************
The incident matrix for the graph are hard coded in the program
The images contains the diagramatic representation of the graph
Four graphs are used
1.undirected disconnected
2.undirected connected
3.directed unconnected
4.directed connected

Images show
-----------
The images included in the assignment are as follows

I have used built in queue and stack to do traversal
